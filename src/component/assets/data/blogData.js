      "When looking to purchase a car, many buyers face the choice between new and used vehicles. However, certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles offer the reliability of new cars with the affordability of used ones. CPO vehicles undergo rigorous inspections, ensuring they meet high standards before being sold. This makes them a smart choice for buyers who want a dependable car without the new-car price tag.",
